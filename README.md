TitanSQL
TitanSQL is a lightweight, distributed relational database built on a disk-based B+ tree. Designed for performance and scalability, it’s perfect for learning about databases, experimenting, or building small-scale distributed systems.
🚀 Features

Efficient Storage: Uses a B+ tree for fast lookups and range queries.
SQL Support: Parses standard SQL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with an ANTLR-based parser.
Concurrency: Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for safe, concurrent transactions.
Distributed Design: Raft consensus ensures fault tolerance and data consistency across nodes.
Optimized I/O: Memory-mapped files and page caching for better performance.

📌 Roadmap

Data sharding for scalability.
Query routing across nodes.
Distributed query optimization.
